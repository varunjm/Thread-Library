## Thread Library and Semaphores

This is an Non Pre-emptive thread library which includes the following thread library functionalities:

#### Threads:
* Create
* Init
* Yield
* Join
* Join All
* Exit

#### Semaphores:
* Init
* Signal
* Wait
* Destroy

### Usage

```
This generates a mythread.a archive file. One can use this as "mythread.h" header in a C/C++ program to use all the functionalities listed above.
